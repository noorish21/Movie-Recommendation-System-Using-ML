        "##Introduction\n",
        "A recommendation system is a technology that provides personalized suggestions or recommendations to users based on their preferences, interests, and past behaviors. It is widely used in various industries, including e-commerce, streaming platforms, social media and more to enhance user experience, increase engagement and drive sales.\n",
        "Recommendation systems utilize various techniques and algorithms to analyze and understand user data. Here are a few commonly used approaches:\n",
        "1. Collaborative Filtering\n",
        "2. Content-Based Filtering\n",
        "3. Hybrid\n",
        "\n",
        "**Here in this system we use Collaborative filtering technique.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Collaborative Filtering** is a popular technique used in recommendation systems that aims to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and behaviors. It leverages the collective information from a group of users to make predictions and suggest items that the users might be interested in.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea behind collaborative filtering is that if two users have similar tastes and preferences, the items they like or dislike are likely to be similar as well. By analyzing the historical data of user-item interactions, such as ratings, reviews, or purchase history, collaborative filtering algorithms can identify patterns and similarities between users to make recommendations."

        "The movie industry has witnessed a tremendous growth in content, with a vast array of movies available across different genres and languages.But there are few works on Bangla Movie Recommendation System. To enhance our local user experience and improve movie discovery, there is a need to develop an effective recommendation system that can provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on other user rating for a specific movie.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The key challenges that need to be addressed in developing a collaborative filtering recommendation system for **Bangla Movie** recommendations are:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Sparsity:** The user-movie interaction data available for training the recommendation system is often sparse, as users typically only rate or interact with a small fraction of the vast movie catalog. This sparsity poses a challenge in accurately capturing user preferences and finding similar users or movies.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cold-Start Problem:** The system needs to handle the cold-start problem, wherein new users or movies have limited or no historical data. The recommendation system must be able to make relevant movie recommendations even for these users or movies with limited information.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scalability and Performance:** As the movie recommendation system needs to handle a large number of users and movies, it should be scalable and capable of processing real-time recommendation requests. It should efficiently process large volumes of data to provide timely and accurate recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overcoming Genre Bias:** The existing recommendation system may have a bias towards popular genres, resulting in a limited diversity of movie recommendations. The collaborative filtering system should mitigate this bias and provide a balance between popular genres and niche or personalized movie recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective is to develop a collaborative filtering recommendation system that leverages user-movie interaction data to provide accurate and personalized movie recommendations, overcoming challenges such as data sparsity, cold-start problem, scalability, and genre bias. The system aims to enhance user satisfaction, improve movie discovery, and increase user engagement on the movie platform."

        "A recommendation system is a technology that provides personalized suggestions or recommendations to users based on their preferences, interests, and past behaviors. It is widely used in various industries, including e-commerce, streaming platforms, social media and more to enhance user experience, increase engagement and drive sales. Recommendation systems utilize various techniques and algorithms to analyze and understand user data. Here are a few commonly used approaches:\n",

Traditional recommendation systems often rely on collaborative filtering techniques, which are based on user behavior and often suffer from the \"cold start\" problem for new users or items.\n",
